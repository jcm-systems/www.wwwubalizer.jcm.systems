		<h1><a href="https://www.wwwubalizer.jcm.systems">WWWubalizer</a> is now defunct</h1>
		<h2>What's this then?</h2>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.wwwubalizer.jcm.systems">WWWubalizer</a> was a service that sent people who manually type in your apex (or "naked") domain over to your main website.</p>
		<p>It has now been turned off.</p>
		<p>All users who informally registered their use of the service were advised of this with plenty of time to stop using it.<p>
		<p>If you still have naked domains pointing at 35.178.28.1, they'll be broken. Search for them in your DNS records and change them to something else.<p>
